# Universal Native Pool Overview

Anyone can become a liquidity provider without permission to obtain income.

Users can provide liquidity by purchasing BFLP using the assets allowed by the liquidity pool. LP tokens are minted when a buy order is completed and burned when sold . The LP token price is calculated by dividing the LP pool value by the total LP supply. After purchasing LP tokens, users can stake these tokens to earn protocol revenue and other token rewards.

**LP Profits Sources:**
- A portion of the fees
- Funding fee payments
- Loss from all traders

**LP Risks**
- Since the pool is the counterparty of traders, LP has positions holding related risks and can suffer losses
